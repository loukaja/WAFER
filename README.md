# wiki-album-formatter
A script for automatically formatting album information with Wikipedia markup.

Supports only finnish for now, maybe sometime in the future I can add support for other languages as well.

Usage: Open Tidal, search for your favorite album, hover over the cover, choose the three dots -> Share -> Copy album link

Then open terminal, and run (for example) "py run.py https://tidal.com/browse/album/80363031"
