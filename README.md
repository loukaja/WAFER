# wiki-album-formatter
A script for automatically formatting album information with Wikipedia markup.

Supports only finnish for now, maybe sometime in the future I can add support for other languages as well.

Usage: Go to Tidal, search for your favorite album, then copy the id after the .../album/ part, and just execute run.py 1234556
